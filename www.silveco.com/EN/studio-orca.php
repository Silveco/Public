                                        Personalization reveals a dimension of direct marketing, which involves communication with an emotional note. The technology developed for personalization in form of images enables you to individually communicate with your clients and business partners in a unique and influential way.

                                        Personalization of advertizing materials with simple printing of a name on the print is something widely used nowadays. We can us this kind of personalization and combine it with finished images on which we print a certain name.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>A more powerful effect of your marketing communication</h3>

In addition, you can surprise your clients with completely unique advertizing material, which communicates with a personal purpose. All our digital systems are connected with special software that enables naming and variability of prints, especially when variations include texts and photos. To put it more simply: although the number of prints is high, we can make each single print different – we can for example add different names, photos, more text, and so on. The biggest advantage of personalized prints is the low price, even though each print is actually different.
