                                    <h3>Classic offset printing</h3>
                                    <p class="lead">
                                        With offset printing we produce high quality prints, we achieve short printing times, we print large format prints and we are cost effective when printing in medium and large quantities.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Cleaner dry offset printing</h3>
                                    <p class="lead">
                                        Along with the classic offset printing we can also print with the technology of dry offset printing. It is worth mentioning, that we are among the first printing houses in South-eastern Europe using this technology. Along with producing high quality prints we take responsibility towards the environment, our employees and end consumers. Because an image forms digitally in the printing machine there is no need to light films, which means we have a cleaner, faster and cheaper graphic process. With this technology SILVECO does not produce emissions of dangerous chemicals into the environment, as water is not needed for moistening of the printing plates. We use paints based on soy oil, which enables the print to decompose faster. Because of that this technology is employee and environment friendly. With the use of dry offset printing and recycled paper or paper with appropriate certificates we can produce an environment friendlier print.

                                    <p class="lead">
                                        Demands for digital prints are steadily increasing in number and deadlines are getting shorter and shorter. There are more and more orders for small quantities of prints. The best answer to these market conditions is digital printing.

                                    <h3>Modern production line</h3>
                                    <p class="lead">
                                        With the help of digital printing we can print the same prints more than once, whereby changing the content of the prints represents no problem. Our digital systems of printing machines represent one of the most modern printing lines in Slovenia and the EU. We use the newest models, which we steadily upgrade and update with new software and additional functions and tools.

                                    <p class="lead">
                                        The consistency of colors does not decrease with amount of prints, the colors of prints are lively, and the resolution is very high. With the short time it takes to prepare for printing we can very quickly produce the first print, so the responsiveness in digital printing is very important. Additionally, this technology enables us to produce for you variable prints. With the so called personalization we can print one kind of print with different texts, images of other elements.

                                        The technologies of digital and dry offset printing are very different, but they have something in common – environment friendly printing. With combinations of these two technologies we successfully print small and large numbers of prints. We encourage our employees, clients, business partners and suppliers to behave responsibly towards our environment. Continual development is becoming one of the foundation stones for the appropriate and long-term functioning of our company.

                                        We consider concern for the environment to be a key element of business behavior and organizational culture of SILVECO. We include responsible behavior towards the environment into our everyday business behavior and thus try to take corporative social responsibility. With this way of doing business we try to decrease negative effects on nature and to improve working conditions for our employees. Our concern for keeping the environment healthy encompasses numerous activities, including saving of natural resources, decreasing the amount of waste and emissions into air, optimal use of resources, and recycling and reuse of products.

                                        The environment friendly printing is represented by digital photo electrographic printing and dry offset printing. We use both techniques; digital printing since 2001 and dry offset printing since 2008.

                                        Personalization reveals a dimension of direct marketing, which involves communication with an emotional note. The technology developed for personalization in form of images enables you to individually communicate with your clients and business partners in a unique and influential way. In SILVECO we use this world leading technology of personalization.

                                        Personalization of advertizing materials with simple printing of a name on the print is something widely used nowadays. We can use this kind of personalization and combine it with finished images on which we print a certain name.

In addition, you can surprise your clients with completely unique advertizing material, which communicates with a personal purpose. All our digital systems are connected with special software that enables naming and variability of prints, especially when variations include texts and photos. To put it more simply: although the number of prints is high, we can make each single print different – we can for example add different names, photos, more text, and so on. The biggest advantage of personalized prints is the low price, even though each print is actually different.
